## Diventi, a modern fantasy game

![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/flavoi/diventi?include_prereleases)

Diventi is a role-playing community that embraces fun, encourages storytelling and helps game masters to create outstanding adventures.

Diventi contains our philosophy of play: a playstyle free from excessive constraints, yet not limited to pure narrative. The role play for us is great involvement of the players, who have fun together playing the protagonists of an adventure.

With Diventi we highlight creativity to help players on the development of their characters, while giving game masters the tools they need to build a satisfying story for all.
